My research agenda addresses \onesenID.
% adapted JMP abstract
In my job market paper, I develop a spatial endogenous growth model to illustrate
how cities help drive aggregate growth by fostering the accumulation of human capital.
I use recent evidence on the dynamic component of the city size wage premium
to quantify the strength of local externalities in the accumulation process.
Because workers accumulate human capital over time at different rates depending
on where they live, the model provides an environment in which spatial policy
can not just attract skilled workers, but produce them, too.
I find that policies that further concentrate skilled workers in large cities
are growth-enhancing.
% rework the transition sentence from your research statement to
In my other work, I use dynamic spatial models to address questions in environmental
economics, such as how agricultural and trade policies affect regional water
scarcity and welfare in a world with weak property rights over water.
